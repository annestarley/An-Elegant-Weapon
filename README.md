# An Elegant Weapon
### Find your lightsaber! This project helps the user determine what lightsaber s/he would build as a force wielder in a galaxy far far away. To do this, the user answers a series of Star Wars related opinion questions while racing against a clock with each new page.   
This project uses javaScript, HTML, and CSS. Within the javaScript file, the following were used:
* DOM manipulation
* Event listeners
* Conditionals
* Timers .
